            A heartwarming farewell gift<br>
                           <br>

             When Gene was diagnosed with melanoma, 
             he had only been given six weeks left to live. 
            It was a shocking diagnosis but Gene decided to 
            use the time he had left to make all the necessary
             arrangements for his wife Carol, with whom he had 
             been married for 30 years. He cashed out his pension 
             and used the money to pay off the house they were 
             living in. The second step was to arrange a trip for 
             his wife Carol and the rest of the family to Italy. 
             When they visited a specific church in Venice, 
             a priest was already waiting for the couple. 
             It was in this church that Geneâ€™s parents had 
             married more than 50 years ago. At that day, 
             Gene and Carol renewed their wedding vows and 
             had the most beautiful day.
            <br><br>
            After Gene had died, his wife Carol discovered that 
            he hid hundreds of Post-it notes around the entire house, 
            shortly before he died. Throughout the course of many months, 
            she found one note after another. The notes are beautiful 
            and very personal statements meant to encourage Carol in 
            this difficult time. But Gene also reminded his wife in these 
            statements to fully enjoy every aspect of life, to sell his 
            car and to move on with her life. It was the most heartwarming
            farewell gift one could ever imagine.
